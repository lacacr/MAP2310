# Code Repository for MAP2310 2024/01

This repository was created as a way to store and share all scripts created by me in order to solve the numerous problems proposed in the MAP2310 discipline that I was part of during the
first semester of 2024 at IME-USP. The subjects tackled in here vary from plotting tangent planes of an ODE to finding the stability region a specific ODE computational solving method.

## Structure of the repository

For ease of use the code is structure in the following manner:
- For each one of the problems solved here there is a folder with all the files related to it (with possible subfolders if there are multiple parts to it)
- Inside each folder two types of files can be found:
  - Python (.py): Where the methods used are implemented
  - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Where examples of those methods are shown
- It is recommended to use the methods within the example files given by only changing the parameters set in there, since those files already have the whole setup ready

## Problems

For ease of reference here is a listing of all problems tackled within this project so far:
- PP4_Q3_I3: Plotting Tangent Plan and simulating Euler and Modified Euler methods convergence (with convergence table)
- P1Q4: Plotting Tangent Plan with Concavity
- P1Q5: Finding Interval and Region of absolute stability for a given W for the method with the following form:
  $$y_{k+1} = y_{k} + \delta{t} f(t_{k} + W\delta{t}, y_{k} + W\delta{t}f(t_{k},y_{k}))$$
